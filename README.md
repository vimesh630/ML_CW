# Machine Learning Coursework Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Coursework repository. This repository contains all the code, datasets, and resources required to perform preprocessing, model training, and comparison between a neural network and a random forest model on the provided dataset.

## Repository Structure

### Files and Folders:

- **`Model_Comparison.ipynb`**
  - Jupyter Notebook that compares the performance of the neural network and random forest models using metrics like accuracy, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves.

- **`neural_network.ipynb`**
  - Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating the neural network model.

- **`random_forest.ipynb`**
  - Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating the random forest model.

- **`preprocessing.ipynb`**
  - Contains the preprocessing steps for the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

- **`Preprocessed dataset.zip`**
  - A zipped file containing the preprocessed dataset used for model training and testing.

- **`Model_Results.zip`**
  - Zipped file containing the saved results of model evaluations (e.g., metrics, plots, predictions).

- **`README.md`**
  - This file provides an overview of the repository structure and usage.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, and `tensorflow`

### Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-coursework.git
   cd machine-learning-coursework
   ```

2. **Setup Environment**:
   Install the required dependencies using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, manually install the libraries listed in the prerequisites.)*

3. **Preprocess the Data**:
   Open and run the `preprocessing.ipynb` file to preprocess the raw dataset.

4. **Train Models**:
   - Run `neural_network.ipynb` to train and evaluate the neural network.
   - Run `random_forest.ipynb` to train and evaluate the random forest model.

5. **Compare Models**:
   Open and run `Model_Comparison.ipynb` to analyze and visualize the performance of both models.
